This project is about training a CIFAR10 dataset using keras.

I trained a CNN model and then optimised it. optimal_CNN_model.py shows the optimised CNN model.

I also trained a resnet model. resnet18.py shows the resnet model.

Experience_while_training.txt is a text file which shows the best CNN model and resnet model that I built for CIFAR10 dataset. It also shows my experience while training and optimising these models.
